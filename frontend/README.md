# 💻 Expense Tracker - Frontend

This is the frontend component of the Expense Tracker application, built with **React 19**, **Vite**, and **Tailwind CSS 4**.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy
The UI is designed to be **intuitive**, **vibrant**, and **accessible**. We use a glassmorphic design language with smooth transitions to ensure a premium user experience.
